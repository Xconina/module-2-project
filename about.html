<h4>My Background</h4>
<div id="mybackground"><p>
    <img src="images/megreen.jpg" id="float"><br>
I haven't always known what path life would take me. I studied psychology in school, and I have worked with children for the past six years.
I love teaching and caring for children, but I am happy to say that I've found other passions to pursue. Graphic design has been one of my interests for the past ten years.
Though I don't think this is something I will pursue professionally, studying it the last year has led me to a new passion. </p><p>
While studying graphic design, I took an interest in web design. First I was mostly interested in UI/UX, but from a design point of view and not development. As I began exploring this,
I ventured into learning HTML and CSS. I started to enjoy this more than the designing! Currently, I am learning more about web development through classes and teaching myself. 
</p>
<p>
    While studying web development, I have also been studying computer science and Python. I have found a love for this, too! I am still unsure
    exactly what my career will be, but I hope to keep learning programming and web development and see where that takes me.
